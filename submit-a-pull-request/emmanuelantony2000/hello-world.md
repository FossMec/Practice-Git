# Hello!!
---
My name is **Emmanuel Antony** and I study here at ***CSB*** class at **MEC**.  

The fields that grab my interest are:
1. Coding
2. Tech
3. Watching movies (MARVEL fanboy)
4. Gymming (Fitness freak)

## Why I am interested to be a part of FOSS? :smiley:
I am interested in opensource tech and software. It enables wider userbase as well as a community development. But I am still a begginer in this field. I am curious by nature, and like to try new things and experiment a lot. And I also look forward to GSOC in the coming years and also contrilbute to the Linux Kernel.

## Languages that I know
1. Python - My favourite language. I strongly feel Python gives power.
2. C++ - My next favourite language. C++ is the actual power but the path to harness it is shabby.
3. Java - Have learned Java for two years but still a noobie.
4. C - Just learned some basic stuff in C before learning Java.
5. HTML/CSS/js/SQL - Just brushed up once for a project.

## Coding
I am a **beginner** in the field of coding and I really love coding.
I did some projects and uploaded the working in **YouTube**.
My [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLG2qxFpd01HGWpl7rA9HA).

## Projects that I have completed
1. Made a header file in CPP for bringing some of the amazing functionality of strings in python like '+' for adding and '*' for multiplying, altogether a user-defined datatype.
2. To visualize differentiation and integration in Python, with the help of matplotlib.
3. To calculate the value of Pi in Python, in some unusual ways.
4. TicTacToe User vs User
5. Eqaution plotter in Python
